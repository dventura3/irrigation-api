# Irrigation Api

This repository contains the implementation of an Irrigation API following the principles of RESTfull architecture.

Each server's response is a [jsonld](http://json-ld.org) document that allows to interpret the semantic of the response.

The server has [RESTdesc](http://restdesc.org) descriptions useful to represent the functionalities of the service.

Currently fake sensors, actuators and plants are used.
